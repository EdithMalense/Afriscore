1️⃣ Model Type

You are using a Random Forest Regressor.

Random Forest is an ensemble method: it builds many decision trees and averages their predictions.

Each tree learns rules like:

“If savings > R10,000 and outstanding loans < R1,000 → credit score likely high.”

“If stockvel contributions are low and monthly payments high → credit score likely low.”

By averaging multiple trees, the model reduces overfitting and becomes more robust to noisy data.

2️⃣ Features Used

The model predicts a numeric credit score (300–850) using four features:

Feature	Description
savings	Total amount saved in individual savings account
stockvel_contribution	Monthly contributions to stokvels
monthly_payments	Amount of recurring monthly payments (utilities, bills, loan installments)
outstanding_loans	Total outstanding loan balancess

These features capture financial behavior and stability, which is what lenders typically consider.

3️⃣ How the Prediction Works

The app collects real user financial data from your SavingsManager and Stokvel info.

These values are passed to the model as a numeric vector: [savings, stockvel_contribution, monthly_payments, outstanding_loans].

Scaling: the model uses StandardScaler to normalize features so all numbers are comparable (savings might be in thousands, loans in hundreds).

Random Forest prediction:

Each tree in the forest makes a prediction of the credit score.

The model averages all tree predictions to produce the final credit score.

The final score is clipped to 300–850 to match standard credit score ranges.

4️⃣ Interpreting the Score

≥ 700 → Excellent credit, low risk

600–699 → Fair credit, moderate risk

< 600 → Poor credit, high risk

So essentially, the model takes your financial data, finds patterns it learned from simulated or historical data, and outputs a score reflecting creditworthiness.

5️⃣ Why Random Forest?

Handles both small and large datasets well.

Can capture non-linear relationships between features and credit score.

Robust against outliers or noisy data.

Provides fast predictions suitable for real-time apps.
